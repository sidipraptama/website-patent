The gland may be recessed within the locking mandrel, or narrower than a seal bore of a landing nipple, such that the gland is protected from damage as the locking mandrel passes through landing nipples to reach a target landing nipple. The expandable metal may be induced to chemically react with a brine or other water-based fluid to form metal hydroxides and may thus create a seal with the target landing nipple. Once an intended purpose of the locking mandrel has been achieved, a pressure reversal may be employed to break the seal and/or a mild acid may be introduced to accelerate dissolving of the expandable metal seal.'}}, {'_index': 'patents', '_id': '11705666', '_score': 1.0, '_source': {'patent_id': '11705666', 'patent_type': 'utility', 'patent_date': '2023-07-18', 'patent_title': 'Water resistant connector for noninvasive patient monitor', 'wipo_kind': 'B2', 'num_claims': 20, 'patent_abstract': 'Systems and methods are provided for water resistant connectors.
